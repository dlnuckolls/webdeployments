            <p>Turley Richards is a talented West Virgina-born singer-songwriter and producer who has been on the verge of stardom several times, only to remain a well kept secret. Damaging his vision in a childhood accident and completely blind by his late 20s, his life has been a whirlwind ride, where predictions of him being "the next big thing" have led to him being signed by seven different labels over the course of his career. Standing at 6' 4", and blessed with a soulful exuberant voice, ...</p>

                  <p>"You have to ask yourself, have you felt pain?" says Turley Richards. "Ask that about African American’s back then and the answer was clear. And me, I can tell you that the blues visited my heart and soul every single day of my life and still do because as a blind man I’ve never seen my children." Turley Richards has certainly known pain, and that comes through in his music, but he’s also positive, very funny, inspiring and committed to recording again after an absence of 20 years...</p>

                <p>Whether you call him Turley Richards or Richard Turley is your choice - he answers to both. Folks who remember the blind musician and his family from South Charleston will go with the latter.

But West Virginia has only one "Superstar": Turley Richards from Charleston. Turley, as so many West Virginians do, turned tragedy into triumph with a musical career that has spanned five decades. Turley is the son of Cody &amp; Silba Turley of South Charleston, West Virginia. Cody was one of seven children of Frank &amp; Mary Price Turley of South Hills. Silba was ...</p>
