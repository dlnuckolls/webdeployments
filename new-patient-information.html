                <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
                <p>Dr. Periago and her team work diligently to provide beautiful smiles and a memorable experience for you and your family. Our practice is proud to serve the people of our wonderful community, and we strive for excellence in all that we do to make sure that you not only achieve the smile of your dreams, but that you thoroughly enjoy yourself along the way!</p>
                <p>There are a few things that you should consider when choosing an orthodontist:</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content-partition">
                <h3>Is your doctor a licensed orthodontic specialist?</h3>
                <p>Did you know that legally a general dentist can also do orthodontics? Is your orthodontic treatment important enough to you that you would choose an office that has a university trained orthodontic specialist that has had an additional two years of training?</p>
                <p>Dr. Periago attended the University of Louisville School of Dentistry where she graduated in 2005 with highest honors, Summa Cum Laude. She was subsequently accepted into the orthodontic residency program at the University of Louisville, where she completed a two-year graduate degree specializing in orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics. Upon completion of her orthodontic residency, Dr. Periago also received her master’s degree in Oral Biology with her research emphasis on three dimensional cone beam radiography in orthodontics. Dr. Periago’s research was accepted for publication and can be found in The Angle Orthodontist journal of orthodontics.</p>
                <p>While attending the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, Dr. Periago was recognized with various awards such as the American Academy of Oral Medicine Award, the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Award, the Excellence in General Pathology Award, and a scholarship for her National Dental Boards Part I score. Dr. Periago was also a Dean’s scholar throughout her dental training and was inducted into the Delphi Society as well as the Omikron Kappa Upsilon dental honor society.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content-partition">
                <h3>Does your doctor devise a customized treatment plan to meet your or your child’s individual needs?</h3>
                <p>Some orthodontists give you their treatment recommendations without taking the diagnostic tests (x-rays, photos and impressions of the teeth) that are necessary to plan treatment. There is no substitute for having all of the information that these records can provide, and taking shortcuts can lead to misdiagnosis resulting in compromised results and increased treatment time.</p>
                <p>Dr. Periago is committed to delivering the best orthodontic care possible, that’s why she invests in state of the art technology and continues to further her orthodontic knowledge through continuing education. Dr. Periago will always do her due diligence before giving her final treatment recommendations by thoroughly reviewing each patients’ diagnostic tests before devising a customized treatment plan. By doing this, Dr. Periago creates a course of treatment that is unique for each patient resulting in the best and most efficient treatment possible.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content-partition">
                <h3>Are you interested in the Invisalign System? Is your doctor a Certified Preferred Invisalign Provider?</h3>
                <p>In addition to traditional braces for children, teens and adults, we are also proud to offer Invisalign, Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Express. Dr. Periago has extensive experience using the Invisalign system. As an Invisalign Preferred Provide, Dr. Periago is uniquely qualified to determine if it is a good option for your overall best treatment outcome. Because of her experience, Dr. Periago is comfortable taking on challenging cases using Invisalign or a combination approach using both Invisalign and traditional braces.</p>

                <p>We understand that most people are genuinely concerned about their financial resources and an investment in orthodontic treatment. First and foremost we do not want finances to stand in the way of our patients and potential patients achieving the beautiful smile that they deserve. Understandably, braces are an investment, and we would love for you to know the many ways that our patients benefit from this investment.</p>
                <p>We provide exceptional orthodontic care to all of our patients. Because Dr. Periago strives to be the best that she can and provide the best treatment for her patients, she invests in very high quality orthodontic products. We are always concerned with what is best for our patients. We are committed to an excellent orthodontic experience that exceeds all expectations, including less patient discomfort. Because of our desire for patients to finish treatment with better results we use costly archwires that place more gentle forces on the teeth leading to less patient discomfort and more precise tooth movement. We also use braces that are not only manufactured with the highest standards of quality but are also as comfortable and esthetic as possible.</p>
                <p>Our Treatment Fee Includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The initial orthodontic examination and all periodic observation visits prior to the start of therapy, the treatment plan and the consultation to discuss our findings, all the orthodontic materials, appliances and appointments (including most emergencies) during the time in braces. Initial retainers after debanding and 12 months of follow-up retainer visits.</li>
                  <li>Reports to your dentist before, during and after the completion of treatment.</li>
                  <li>Verbal treatment updates at each visit when possible as to the progress of the treatment and the status of the oral hygiene.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because every mouth is different and cases range from relatively straight forward to very difficulty, we always quote customized fees. The difficulty of treatment depends on the severity of the patient’s problem. At your initial consultation you will be able to discuss fees and payment options with our Financial Coordinators before treatment begins. We have payment plans to suit different budgets, including a no-down-payment option. We also accept assignment from most insurance plans, and we’ll file the necessary papers to your insurance company. We work hard to make orthodontics affordable so that everyone can live life smiling.</p>
            
                <h5>Payment Options</h5>
                <p>In an effort to keep orthodontic fees down while maintaining the highest level of professional care, we offer the following financial arrangements:</p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If full payment is made at the onset of treatment, we will offer an overall fee discount.</li>
                    <li>Down payment with monthly payments and no interest charged.</li>
                    <li>Electronic Payment (credit card or bank account). For your convenience automatic monthly payments are available either through your credit card or bank account.
                    <a href="assets/docs/electronic-payment-authorization.pdf">Click here</a> for of our electronic payment authorization form. You can print it, fill it out and bring it with you to the next appointment!</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Insurance</h5>
                <p>In many cases, patients will have some type of orthodontic insurance, which will usually cover a part of the treatment fee. If you have insurance, we will be happy to help you to determine the coverage available. If you would like to assign your insurance benefit, we will be able to structure a payment plan for the balance. Ultimately, any unpaid balance will be the patient’s responsibility to pay. Professional care is provided to you, our patient, and not to an insurance company. Thus, the insurance company is responsible to the patient and the patient is responsible to the doctor. We will help in every way we can in filing your claim and handling insurance questions from our office on your behalf.</p>
                <p>It’s important that people get the orthodontic care they need when they need it. Orthodontics is an investment for the future… a future of improved dental health and appearance. Our goal is not only to meet all of your expectations, but to exceed your expectations in all areas of our service.</p>

                <p>Our greatest goal is to give you the healthy, straight, beautiful smile that you’ve always wanted.

                <h4>Every Smile starts with a complimentary Initial Consultation</h4>
                <p>Your first visit to our office is complimentary and is designed to provide you with as much information about your orthodontic and dental needs as possible. During this visit, you will have the opportunity to meet our team, learn more about orthodontics, receive a complete initial exam and find out which treatment options will best meet your needs.</p>
                <p>Upon arriving to our office you will be greeted by our front office team whom is always eager to assist. We pride ourselves on always running on time, so if you wait longer than 10 minutes past your scheduled appointment time, please let one of our team members know! Feel free to help yourself to refreshments while you wait in our comfortable and relaxing reception area.</p>
                <p>At your complimentary initial examination our New Patient Coordinator will obtain a full set of digital images as well as a panoramic and cephalometric digital x-rays. These initial images will help Dr. Periago provide you with an accurate initial diagnosis and treatment plan. After you begin treatment, Dr. Periago will study these images to devise a customized treatment plan for you or your child.</p>
                <p>At the time of the complete oral exam Dr. Periago will go over in detail all pertinent findings. In most cases, she will let you know specifically what, if any, orthodontic treatment is needed. Dr. Periago believes in providing patients with as much information as possible in order to allow them to make an informed decision in selecting the treatment option that best suits them. You will never feel rushed and you will have ample time to discuss any orthodontic treatment questions that you may have with Dr. Periago. After the exam and consultation our Financial Coordinator will discuss all scheduling information as well as financial information, insurance options and payment plans.</p>
                <p>Dr. Periago and the whole Periago Ortho team will be glad to answer any questions you may have, and we will provide all of the information that you need to determine which treatment is right for you. Please contact our practice to schedule your initial consultation today!</p>
            
                <h4>What happens after the initial consultation?</h4>
                <p>After your complimentary consultation, you are one step closer to achieving the smile you’ve always wanted! Depending on the diagnosis from your customized treatment plan, Dr. Periago will recommend a course of treatment for you or your child. As no mouth is the same, no treatment plan or scheduling sequence is the same. At this time, our well trained Scheduling Coordinators will make sure that your sequence of appointments is scheduled appropriately. You will subsequently come in to either be fitted for a custom made appliance or to have the braces placed.)</p>
                
                <p>The actual placement of the braces typically only takes about 30 to 45 minutes, but you will be scheduled for 90 minutes in order to provide ample time for detailed instruction on your new life with braces. Dr. Periago and her team will discuss every aspect of life with braces from oral hygiene to do’s and don’ts; and will go above and beyond to teach you new techniques to help you with brushing and care of your braces. We will also let you know when your next follow up appointment should be scheduled. Our use of cutting edge technology allows patients to be seen at a 4 to 8 week intervals with an average adjustment appointment length of 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
            
                <h4>Scheduling Appointments</h4>
                <p>Visiting the orthodontist about every four to eight weeks is an important part of your orthodontic treatment. Our practice will work with you to make sure that your appointments are as convenient as possible. When scheduling appointments, please let us know what days and times work best for you.</p>
                <p>We understand that “life happens”! If you’re running late or need to reschedule, please let us know and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. When you’re ready to schedule your first appointment, contact our practice and our caring team will be more than happy to assist you. We’re looking forward to working with you!</p>

Dread about the money, dread about how she was going to feel... Dread about everything.. I shouldn't have felt dread. All of the employees are wonderful and put her at ease. They have all been extremely kind and make you feel comfortable. They break down the cost into affordable payments which has been a major relief. I will refer this office to everyone who asks me.</div>

So I did....I am so thankful I chose them, because from day one the entire staff made myself and my daughter Savannah so comfortable. Everyone in the office is so nice. Not to mention they seem like they just have fun working together. The whole atmosphere seems so inviting. Thanks to the entire staff for making our decision a great one</div>

                <div class="testimonial-profile-info">My son has been going here for almost two years, and we have been very happy with his orthodontic treatment, the customer service, and the "chair side manor" of everyone here. Before starting his treatment, which has been pretty extensive and included surgery, he had a strong phobia of any medical care and appointments were difficult. Two years later at 17 he now drives himself to his appointments and has no anxiety. Consistently kind and gentle treatment has certainly helped him. The payment options they offer are so helpful as well.</div>
